<h2>Overview</h2>

<h2>Observations & Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Young males make up the vast majority of this data set.  75.74% of the Players in this data set fall between the ages of 15 and 29 years old, and overall, males accounted for 84% of all purchases.</li>
  <li>Almost half (44.79%) of the active players are between the ages of 20 and 24, with the next most dense age demographic accounting for less that half of that (15-19 year olds).</li>
  <li>Interestingly enough, the top three most expensive items were also in the top three most popular purchases. It is reasonable to conclude that these customers are not price sensitive, meaning there could be room to develop more higher-priced items.</li>
